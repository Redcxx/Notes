#### Definition

A graph is G = (V, E). V = **finite** and non-empty set, E = set of order pair of **distinct** v. V are **vertices** and E are **edges**.

If e = (u,v) in E then u and v are **neighbor** and incident on e.

- no self-loop
- no multiple edges
- no directionless edges

By default we assume graph is stored in adjacency list, where each vertices associated with a linked-list (because size is small and variable) of other vertices where it has an outgoing edge.

- in-degree: # incoming edges
- out-degree: # outgoing edges
- path: sequence of distinct vertices such that if i < j, then (vi, vj) is an edge
- reachable if there exists a path
- strongly connected if every v is reachable from every other.
- topological sorting: an order of v such that for all (vi, vj) we have i < j.
- strongly connected  component: every node is reachable from other in that component.

- st-con: test if t is reachable from s in g
- strong connectivity: test if g is strongly connected
- cyclicity: test if g contains cycle

- topological sorting: compute topological sorting of g
  - by product: check contains cycle
- strongly connected component: find strongly connected components of g

- lemma: directed graph + no cycles = v with 0 in-degree



- dfs O(e+v)

  ```
  def dfs(g, v):
  	mark v
  	for each (v, u) in g:
  		if u is not marked:
  			dfs(g, u)
  ```

- topological sorting O(e+v)

  ```
  def t_sorting(g):
  	list;
  	for v in g:
  		if in-degree of v == 0:
  			list.add(v)
  			g.remove(v)
  	if list is empty:
  		print "contains cycle"
  	else:
          list.addAll(t_sorting(g))
      return list
  
  def t_sorting(g):
  	list, map, stack;
  	for v in g:
  		map[v] = in-degree of v
  		if map[v] == 0:
  			stack.push(v)
  	while stack is not empty:
  		# when v is popped, all its predecessor must be popped already
  		# so it is added after its predecessor is added
  		v = stack.pop()  
  		list.add(v)
  		for (v, u) in g:
  			if --map[u] == 0:
  				stack.push(u)
  	if list.size() != g.size():
  		# if some v is not indexed, then it has cycle
  		return "contains cycle"
  	else:
  		# if all v is indexed, then we have a topological sorting
  		return list
  ```

- strongly connected component (tarjan's algorithm)

  ```
  def scc_tarjan(g):
  	list of scc;
  	for v in g:
  		if v.index undefined:
  			sc(g, v, 0, new stack, list of scc)
  	return list of scc
  
  def sc(g, v, index, stack, list):
	v.index = index
  	v.lowlink = index
  	v.on_stack = true
  	stack.push(v)
  	
  	for (v, u) in g:
  		if u.index undefined:
  			sc(g, v, index+1)
  			v.lowlink = min(v.lowlink, u.lowlink)
  		else if u.on_stack:
  			v.lowlink = min(v.lowlink, u.index)
  			
  	if v.index == v.lowlink:
  		scc = new list;
  		repeat:
  			w = stack.pop()
  			w.on_stack = false
  			scc.add(w)
  		while w != v
  		list.add(scc)
  	return list
