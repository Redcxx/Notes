## Weilue's Project Plan

My project is on Music Generation, 

Today is 23 Oct, the presentation starts from 8 Mar, this is 20 weeks in total. I will reserve 8 weeks for examinations & other project. So I have 12 weeks to work on the project.

### 1-4 Weeks

- I will spend at least 2 weeks on research and reading prior work (papers), I have already found some interesting projects, in particular, museGAN, JukeBox project and their related work, but these are most recent work and I think it is important to understand older works as well, I will try to start from around 2015 (depends on references in the paper, wavenet, pixelcnn, etc.), the planned work is at most 12 papers, this means I will try to digest about one paper per day.
- Secondly, I will try experiment with their models and try to come up with a number of architectures to try. This can be long but I will try to cut it down a bit, it should take no more than 2 weeks.
- Lastly, I will look for some datasets that is suitable for my project, but this task is not something fundamentally important so I may leave this to next stage.

### 5-9 Weeks

- I will probably spend one week to familiar myself with all the technology, it had been sometime since I write python code, it should take just a week.
- For the next 3 weeks I will try to develop the model and try different variations on it.

### 10-12 Weeks

At this point I should have the model ready, the last thing to do perhaps is to further fine tune the model, produce the result, clean up the code and produce a final report.
