Stackelberg game: leader - follower

- **Retail Pricing Games**
  Two gas station, ASDA and Shell, when ASDA make a price move, Shell will make a response.

  - leader: ASDA, follower: Shell
  - Strategy space: infinite, price are real number.
  - There are private information within players, ASDA may not know Shell's pay-off

- **Duopoly/Oligopoly game in economic**

  - market dominate by single company: monopoly
  - market dominate by two companies: duopoly
  - market dominate by a few companies: Oligopoly

  We have three major oil companies, OPEC, OECD and Russia, OPEC is at a more dominate position. OPEC first announces an increase/decrease crude oil output, Russia and OECD will act accordingly to decide whether to increase/decrease oil output.

  - infinite strategy space, 0 to max capability
  - each player does not know other's economic/political motivation

- **Wholesale pricing game in supply chain**
  Supplier announce their price, then retailers decide their order. Supplier can set price according to quantity of order, e.g. £10 for order less than 100 units and £8 for order more than 100 units.
  There competitions between suppliers, retailers, and supplier and retailers. The information is very little.

In stackerelberg games, player select action sequentially, which is different from nash games where players select action simultaneously. We will use $P_{L/F}$ to denote player, $U_{L/F}$ to denote strategy space
