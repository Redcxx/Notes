Stackelberg game: leader - follower

- **Retail Pricing Games**
  Two gas station, ASDA and Shell, when ASDA make a price move, Shell will make a response.

  - leader: ASDA, follower: Shell
  - Strategy space: infinite, price are real number.
  - There are private information within players, ASDA may not know Shell's pay-off

- **Duopoly/Oligopoly game in economic**

  - market dominate by single company: monopoly
  - market dominate by two companies: duopoly
  - market dominate by a few companies: Oligopoly

  We have three major oil companies, OPEC, OECD and Russia, OPEC is at a more dominate position. OPEC first announces an increase/decrease crude oil output, Russia and OECD will act accordingly to decide whether to increase/decrease oil output.

  - infinite strategy space, 0 to max capability
  - each player does not know other's economic/political motivation

- **Wholesale pricing game in supply chain**
  Supplier announce their price, then retailers decide their order. Supplier can set price according to quantity of order, e.g. ¬£10 for order less than 100 units and ¬£8 for order more than 100 units.
  There competitions between suppliers, retailers, and supplier and retailers. The information is very little.

#### Formulation

In stackerelberg games, player select action sequentially, which is different from nash games where players select action simultaneously. 

We will use $P_{L/F}$ to denote player, $U_{L/F}$ to denote strategy space, $J_{L/F}(U_L,U_F)$ to denote pay-off function, the objective is to maximize the pay-off function. Note that the pay-off function depends on both leader and follower's strategy space. The sales is denoted as $S_{L/F}=D_L(U_L,U_F)=a+bU_L+cU_F$. Where $a$ represents the sales independent of both strategy space, $bU_L$ and $cU_F$ represents the sales impact by own/other's strategy, of-course, the strategy from the opponent usually yield $b/c$ negative. Then our pay-off function can be represented as $J_{L/F}(U_L,U_F)=(U_{L/F}-C_{L/F})\times D_{L/F}(U_L,U_F)$. where $C_{L/F}$ represents the cost; that is, $\text{profit per unit}\times \text{sales}=\text{total profit}$. The follower is trying maximize its own profit by finding a best response to the leader's strategy, i.e. $J_F(U_L,R(U_L))=\max_{u_F\in U_F}J_F(U_L,u_F)$.

If there exists a leader strategy such that it gives the maximum profit for the best response the follower give, then it is called a stackelberg strategy or stackelberg equilibrium.

#### Analysis

The player who act first is the leader, it does not require him to be in a dominate position. A stackelberg game can be continuous or discrete, dependent on its strategy space is finite or infinite.   

In stackelberg games, we assume the follower is rational, which may not be true in real life. For example the monopoly supplier may take 90% of the profit and leave 10% for the retailers, you may assume the retailer has no choice, but he may reject the offer and buy nothing, forcing the supplier to change strategy.

If there exists both nash strategy and stackelberg strategy for a game, being a leader in the stackelberg game is better (at least equivalent) than being a player in the nash game. This is because in stackelberg game, you

But it is not always good to be leader, for example, Áî∞ÂøåËµõÈ©¨.

### Homework

- A stackelberg strategy is a strategy for leader where it gives the maximum profit for leader with the best response the follower give.
- A definition of the stackelberg ga me is given by two types of players, leader/follower denote as $P_L/P_F$, and their corresponding strategy space denote as $U_L/U_F$, and the corresponding pay-off function $J_{L/F}(U_L,U_F)$. The leader wants to maximize its pay-off function $J_L(U_L,R(U_L))$ and follower wants to maximize its pay-off function $J_F(U_L,U_F)$, during the game, the leader will act first and follower follows. A stackelberg strategy is when there exists a $u_L\in U_L$ such that it gives the maximum profit for the best response the follower can give.

1. A stackelberg equilibrium in this scenario is a strategy for leader $u^*_L\in U_L$ such that it maximize the outcome for the leader with the best response from both followers, denoted as $u^*_{F1} \in U_{F1}, u^*_{F2} \in U_{F2}$ that maximize their own pay-off function.

2. a. a player is the leader if he act first.
   b. leader, **without knowing the private information of the follower, the leader will be unable to figure out the follower‚Äôs reaction function and achieve the max payoff. **.
   c. False, this is only true if there exists both stackelberg equilibrium and nash equilibrium.
3. The stackelberg equilibrium is when leader choose 0 and follower choose 1, that is, (0, 1).

## Lecture 2

#### Function maximization problem

let say we have a function: $-2x^2+4x+5$ and $x\in [0,5]$, and want to find the maximum value of the function, note that this function is equal to $-2(x^2-2x+1)+7$, which is equal to $-2(x^2-1)^2+7\le 7=f(1)$. So our maximum value occur at $x=1$.

1. find all local maximum points by find the first derivatives and verify its second derivative is negative.
2. find all boundary points
3. calculate f(x) for all x in step 1 and 2 and find the x that yields the highest output.

### Homework

1. **The statement is false. Consider function f(x) = 1/x on interval [ùëé, ùëè] = [1,2], which reaches its max value at the boundary point ùëé = 1, but f ‚Äò(1) = ‚àí1 ‚â† 0. The calculation of the derivative is given below: Based on the derivative formula (ùë•^n)‚Ä≤ = ùëõùë•^{n-1}, the derivative f'(x) = -1/x^2**
2. Yes. f'(x\*) = 0 means that its gradient is zero at that point, and f''(x\*) means that it is maximum point instead of minimum.
3. 1.6, if optimal point outside bound, then optimal point must be at the boundary.

## Lecture 3

#### Demand Model

- Demand Models: mathematical model that describe sales change by price change
- Linear Demand Model: $S_L=D_L(u_L,u_F)=a_1+b_1u_L+c_1u_F$.
- Consistency of demand model: If own price decrease, then own sales increase; if competitor price decrease, then own sales decreases.
  - b1 < 0, c1 > 0; b2 > 0, c2 < 0.
  - b2 < -b1; c1 < -c2
    This simply says that the own price change affects ourselves more than other players.

### Follower Function

<img src="COMP34120 S2.assets/image-20210225095108003.png" alt="image-20210225095108003" style="zoom:50%;" />

The follower's strategy first derivative is $2c_2u_F+b_2u_L+a_2-c_Fc_2$, second derivative is $2c_2$. We know when first derivative equals to 0, we have max/min point, and we know that $c_2<0$, this confirms it is maximum point, so the follower's global optimal function is indeed $u_F=-\frac{b_2u_L+a_2-c_Fc_2}{2c_2}$. Let's check the boundary:

<img src="COMP34120 S2.assets/image-20210225100012392.png" alt="image-20210225100012392" style="zoom: 50%;" />

### Leader Function

<img src="COMP34120 S2.assets/image-20210225100508409.png" alt="image-20210225100508409" style="zoom:50%;" />

After substituting the follower's optimal reaction function, we have $(u_L-c_L)(a_1+\beta_1u_L+\beta_0)$ where $\beta_1=b_1-\frac{c_1b_2}{2c_2}$ and$\beta_0=-\frac{c_1(a_2-c_fc_2)}{2c_2}$.

<img src="COMP34120 S2.assets/image-20210225100623821.png" alt="image-20210225100623821" style="zoom:50%;" />

Then similar to solving follower's function, we have the leader's optimal function first derivative as $u_L=\frac{a_1+\beta_0-c_L\beta_1}{2\beta_1}$, and second derivative is $2\beta_1=2\left(b_1-\frac{c_1b_2}{2c_2}\right)=\frac{1}{c_2}(2c_2b_1-c_1b_2)$, from above we know $(2c_2b_1-c_1b_2)>0$ and $c_2<0$, so second derivative is indeed negative and this function gives global maximum point.

#### Theorem

 note we need continuous payoff function.
