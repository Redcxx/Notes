## Lecture 1

Internet of things (IoT) is **defined** by a global infrastructure <u>for the information society</u>, enabling advanced services by interconnecting things (physical and virtual) based on existing and evolving <u>interoperable information and communication</u> technologies.

Its **vision** is to have specialized elements of hardware and software, connected by wires, radio-waves or infrared, so ubiquitous that no one will notice their presence.

Its components include responsive store, municipal command & control centre, smart grid, intelligent medical devices, connected ambulances, intelligent digital store, automated car system, traffic camera, logistic optimization, factory optimization, traffic flow optimization, home energy management, communication network optimizations etc... interconnected to form cloud and services.

IoT can also add a dimension to communication, rather than communicating through time and place, any thing can be intercommunicated by using generic equipment.

IoT was enabled by the rise of technology, for the past 10 years, bandwidth improved by 1000x while cost decrease by 40x, cost of computing IC reduced by 60x and the capacity for disk increased by more than 10000x while cost reduced by 17x.

#### Physical and Virtual

Physical things exists in the physical world, they can be identified, connected, send and/or actuate. Virtual things exists in the virtual world and maybe associated with a physical thing.

#### IoT System Basic Organization

The IoT system on the edge consists of devices like sensors and monitors, these components are connected to the backend, like cloud platform, APIs and cloud applications by the internet.

These devices' minimum requirement is to communicate, through different methods, like device-to-device, through communication network with/without a gateway or some combination of these methods. Each devices will have some capability to take critical decision as for some cases sending data through the internet can be slow. The gateway facilitate communication by translating protocols, but nowadays it may also has some computing capability to handle some critical tasks that requires low latency.

The IoT system has the following primary characteristics:

- interconnectivity
- heterogeneity (异质)
- dynamic changes
- scale and complexity

and the following basic requirements:

- Identification-based connectivity
- Interoperability (互通)
- Security
- Privacy

The services these devices provide can be categorized into 4 classes, **identify-related** services, **information aggregation** services, **collaborative-aware** services and **ubiquitous** (无处不在) services.

data -> information -> knowledge. 

## Lecture 2

#### Describe an IoT system

We use Architecture Reference Model (ARM) to describe IoT system, before we talk about what devices is in the system.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215161526457.png" alt="image-20210215161526457" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Reference Model is an abstraction at the highest possible level, it intends to establish a common ground for all IoT systems.
- Reference Architecture is utilized for building system specific architectures, it provides **views** and **perspectives** on different architectural aspects that can be of interest to the related stakeholders of the system.
- Guidelines are replaced by design methodology later

#### Views and Perspectives

Each view describe a different aspect of the system. 

- **Functional** view describe the functional component of the system, not necessarily includes the interaction.
- **Information** view provides an overview of the structure of the static information handled by the system and the information flow. It does not tells you how information is changed within the system.
- **Deployment** view focus on the component and technologies (hardware and software) that implement the system and how these interact compliant to specific system requirements.

We can also use high level use case/scenarios to show how to offer solution and derive the architecture.

In **functional/context** view, we gain overview of each components, pretty abstract, no interaction, but it tells you what the aimed/envisioned system should contain:

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215181410334.png" alt="image-20210215181410334" style="zoom:33%;" /> 

In **data/information** view, it shows what kind of data is collected, where/how it is collected, format etc.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215181824863.png" alt="image-20210215181824863" style="zoom:33%;" />

In **deployment** view, it shows what framework is being used, how data is sent etc, mostly informative.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215181928861.png" alt="image-20210215181928861" style="zoom:33%;" />

#### Model and Architecture

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215182023699.png" alt="image-20210215182023699" style="zoom: 50%;" />

The model guides the architecture.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215182408237.png" alt="image-20210215182408237" style="zoom: 33%;" />

communication is important, therefore it has a separate model.

#### Relations

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215182600563.png" alt="image-20210215182600563" style="zoom:50%;" />

aggregation and composition differ by the life-time of the relation, composition is more like a part-of relation, they are strongly connected. For example, leaf on the flower is composition, while flower in the pot is aggregation relation, you can feel that leaf is part of the flower, but flower is not necessarily part of the pot.

association tells you the nature of association between objects. Directed association is similar. Reflective association means that some objects within the same class is associated. The \* and $1$ in the association relation denote the one-to-many, many-to-one relation.

#### Domain Model

The model consists of different elements:

- **User** can be any animated/inanimate objects
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215184051685.png" alt="image-20210215184051685" style="zoom: 33%;" />
  Here the user *is-a* human user.

- **Physical entity** can be any physical object or part of the environment that can be identified. e.g. humans, animals, rooms, stores, cars....

  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215184258571.png" alt="image-20210215184258571" style="zoom:33%;" />
  the relation shown is any-to-many (?any-to-any).

- **Virtual entity** are digital artefacts, each can be classified as active/passive. Passive entity includes database entries, active entity includes running software applications or services that may access other services or resources.
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215184603658.png" alt="image-20210215184603658" style="zoom:33%;" />
  note the virtual entity need to some how connect to a physical entity, otherwise we cannot interact with it.
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215184919996.png" alt="image-20210215184919996" style="zoom: 33%;" />
  the dash arrow are realization relationship, which means the virtual entity can be realized as active or passive artefact. Then we have the arrow that denote generalization, is-a relation. The xor here means that it is either of them but not both.

In domain model, a device is typically attached to a physical entity relates an object of the physical world to a virtual entity in the digital world of the internet. It typically categorized as:

- **sensors**: provide information, knowledge, or data about the physical entity they monitor, it ranges from identity to measurement of physical states.
- **tags**: used to identify the physical object.
- **actuators**: used to modify the physical state of the entity.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215185548037.png" alt="image-20210215185548037" style="zoom: 33%;" />

## Lecture 3

A physical entity can be relate to a device as follows, where purple box denote a hardware and grey is unclassified.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210219173130355.png" alt="image-20210219173130355" style="zoom: 50%;" />

### Resource

A **resource** is a software component that provides the data used in actuation on the physical entities. It is distinguished as:

- **on-device**: hosted on device together with the physical entity, e.g. executable code for accessing, processing and storing sensor information and controlling actuators.
- **network**: available somewhere on the internet, e.g. backend or cloud-based databases.

### Service

A service expose resources and offer the necessary functionality for interacting with the device/resource associated with the physical entities. The relation between **resources and virtual entities** are modelled as association between **services and virtual entities**. (note service provide the resources for the virtual entities). The interaction between virtual entities and services are done via the network.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210219175111404.png" alt="image-20210219175111404" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Generic Model



<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210220145312694.png" alt="image-20210220145312694" style="zoom:50%;" />

The augmented entity is just a combine of both entities, to make things complete. Reflexive relation means that it may contain things of the same type.

### Example

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210220161400440.png" alt="image-20210220161400440" style="zoom:50%;" />

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210220161652433.png" alt="image-20210220161652433" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Information Model

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210220162958841.png" alt="image-20210220162958841" style="zoom:50%;" /> 

e.g virtual entity can be soil, attribute can be acidity/temperature/humidity, metadata may tells the format for the temperature/time etc.

- functional model capture functionalities in different concepts

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210220154831044.png" alt="image-20210220154831044" style="zoom:50%;" />

There are also service organization functional group that used for composing and orchestrating services of different levels of abstraction. It links high level requests such as the IoT Process Management Functional Group or external applications to basic services that exposes resources. e.g. translation of "give me pressure value of valve 34" to "sensor service AB".

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210220171739728.png" alt="image-20210220171739728" style="zoom:50%;" />

## Lecture 4

The Communication Functional Group abstract a variety of communication from many technologies in the IoT system and provide common interface. It is derived from the Communication Model with requirements for specific IoT system. It has to consider the followings:

- end to end path information
- addressing issues (locator/id splits)
- network management
- device specific features

Types of communication:

- **human - service**
  This is the most common type of communication, user typically interacts with services through software over the internet. It uses the standard internet-based protocol.
- **service - service**
  We have to be careful if any of the service belongs to a constrained network, for example, services deployed on constrained devices such as sensor; elements are in different subnetwork, gateway/proxy/constrained protocol should be used.
- service/device/resource interactions

The communication model define the functional components in the communication functional group of the functional model. The functional requirement includes lifetime of the device, responsiveness, robustness, sensor sampling frequency, power etc; non-functional requirements includes regulations, installation, maintenance, size and weights, cost, etc.

### Methodology

1. We first define the **objectives and requirements** of the IoT systems, 
2. Define the **Process Model Specification** with use cases of the system, 
3. Form the **domain model**, includes **PE, VE**, resources and services,
4. Define the **information model**, includes entity type, attribute name/type, metadata,
5. Produce the **service descriptions**,
6. Show how the system will be deployed using **IoT level specification**,
7. Map the IoT level specification to a **functional view**,
8. Define options with optional **view specification**.
9. Develop and **integrate** devices and components
10. **Develop** the application

### IoT system (step 6)

deployment level with increasing difficulties.

- **level 1**
  handles little, do not have significant requirements when it comes to storage/data analysis etc. e.g. smart home system.

  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222142605220.png" alt="image-20210222142605220" style="zoom:33%;" />

- **level 2**
  The system is more elaborate at this level, e.g. a smart system in a warehouse, where you may need plenty of data.

  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222143130347.png" alt="image-20210222143130347" style="zoom:33%;" />

- **level 3**
  level 2 is similar to level 3, but the analysis takes place in the cloud instead of locally (only a little) in the monitoring node.

- **level 4**

  This level has the observer node, can only observe data, e.g. allow external party to retrieve data (as observer).
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222143319547.png" alt="image-20210222143319547" style="zoom:33%;" />

- **level 5**
  Coordinator, routers/endpoints is added. The routers may be some kind of things that support some connectivity, they send their data to the coordinator which supports full 7 OSI layers which means it can connect to the internet, it may do some processing/refinement to the data before sending them to the cloud.
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222143840720.png" alt="image-20210222143840720" style="zoom:33%;" />

- **level 6**

  The controller now became centralized, like a gateway, and it is in the cloud. It takes data from the nodes and have some elaborate functionalities before sending the data to the cloud storage.
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222144100883.png" alt="image-20210222144100883" style="zoom:33%;" />

### Case Study: Home Automation System

- **step 1 objectives and requirements**
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222144435449.png" alt="image-20210222144435449" style="zoom:33%;" />

  Since data analysis is local, we know that data is little, so IoT system level 1 is enough.

- **Step 2 process model specification**
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222145939108.png" alt="image-20210222145939108" style="zoom:33%;" />

  we just translate the objectives to different attributes and state of the system.

- **step 3 domain model specification**

  - we have users such as owner of the house.
  - we have physical entities such as light bulb and room.
  - we have devices such as light level sensor, light switch actuator.
  - some service to link and send command.

  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222153148869.png" alt="image-20210222153148869" style="zoom: 33%;" />

- **Step 4 information model**
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222155226478.png" alt="image-20210222155226478" style="zoom:33%;" />

- **step 5 Produce the service descriptions**

  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222155537686.png" alt="image-20210222155537686" style="zoom: 33%;" />
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222155557242.png" alt="image-20210222155557242" style="zoom:33%;" />
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222155735165.png" alt="image-20210222155735165" style="zoom:33%;" />

  


## Lecture 5

- **Step 6 IoT system**
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210302084213030.png" alt="image-20210302084213030" style="zoom:33%;" />

### Case Study: Weather Monitoring Station

- **Step 1**
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210302085645786.png" alt="image-20210302085645786" style="zoom:33%;" />

  We will probably have many nodes, so coordinator is probably needed, so the IoT level is about 5-6. But it also depends on the scale, as you may only want to check the weather within a small area (10 nodes then level 4 can be a good choice).

- **Step 2**
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210302085719422.png" alt="image-20210302085719422" style="zoom:33%;" />

- **Step 3**
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210302085746161.png" alt="image-20210302085746161" style="zoom:33%;" />
  Another useful device to have is the tag that represent where the sensor is.

- **Step 4**
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210302090700635.png" alt="image-20210302090700635" style="zoom:33%;" />
  The id should be there for the virtual entity, but we only have one here, so we omit it.
- **Step 5**
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210302091121228.png" alt="image-20210302091121228" style="zoom:33%;" />

> Part 2

### IoT Stack

IoT stack is not same as the ISO/OSI model because we need something that work across all things, so a model that is simpler and efficient is needed.

app->transport->network/ip->link->physical. (This course will focus on transport and physical layer )

internet is not generally used but this does not mean HTTP is not used. 

**Interoperability (互操作性)** is needed.

- **physical**
  we need hardware that support different standards. For example to solve bandwidth issues .

- **Link**
  we need link layer that support different communication standards.

- **network & ID**
  Support different addressing mechanism. e.g. address translation, ip4/6.

- **end-to-end**

  Here we ensure the communication between cloud and iot node is reliable. handle e.g. packets lost.

- **data**
  decide whether we allow some communication protocol to be run.
