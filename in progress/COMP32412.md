# Lectures

## Lecture 1

Internet of things (IoT) is **defined** by a global infrastructure <u>for the information society</u>, enabling advanced services by interconnecting things (physical and virtual) based on existing and evolving <u>interoperable information and communication</u> technologies.

Its **vision** is to have specialized elements of hardware and software, connected by wires, radio-waves or infrared, so ubiquitous that no one will notice their presence.

Its components include responsive store, municipal command & control centre, smart grid, intelligent medical devices, connected ambulances, intelligent digital store, automated car system, traffic camera, logistic optimization, factory optimization, traffic flow optimization, home energy management, communication network optimizations etc... interconnected to form cloud and services.

IoT can also add a dimension to communication, rather than communicating through time and place, any thing can be intercommunicated by using generic equipment.

IoT was enabled by the rise of technology, for the past 10 years, bandwidth improved by 1000x while cost decrease by 40x, cost of computing IC reduced by 60x and the capacity for disk increased by more than 10000x while cost reduced by 17x.

### Physical and Virtual

Physical things exists in the physical world, they can be identified, connected, send and/or actuate. Virtual things exists in the virtual world and maybe associated with a physical thing.

### IoT System Basic Organization

The IoT system on the edge consists of devices like sensors and monitors, these components are connected to the backend, like cloud platform, APIs and cloud applications by the internet.

These devices' minimum requirement is to communicate, through different methods, like device-to-device, through communication network with/without a gateway or some combination of these methods. Each devices will have some capability to take critical decision as for some cases sending data through the internet can be slow. The gateway facilitate communication by translating protocols, but nowadays it may also has some computing capability to handle some critical tasks that requires low latency.

The IoT system has the following primary characteristics:

- interconnectivity
- heterogeneity (异质)
- dynamic changes
- scale and complexity

and the following basic requirements:

- Identification-based connectivity
- Interoperability (互通)
- Security
- Privacy

The services these devices provide can be categorized into 4 classes, **identify-related** services, **information aggregation** services, **collaborative-aware** services and **ubiquitous** (无处不在) services.

data -> information -> knowledge. 

## Lecture 2

### Describe an IoT system

We use Architecture Reference Model (ARM) to describe IoT system, before we talk about what devices is in the system.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215161526457.png" alt="image-20210215161526457" style="zoom:50%;" />

- Reference Model is an abstraction at the highest possible level, it intends to establish a common ground for all IoT systems.
- Reference Architecture is utilized for building system specific architectures, it provides **views** and **perspectives** on different architectural aspects that can be of interest to the related stakeholders of the system.
- Guidelines are replaced by design methodology later

### Views and Perspectives

Each view describe a different aspect of the system. 

- **Functional** view describe the functional component of the system, not necessarily includes the interaction.
- **Information** view provides an overview of the structure of the static information handled by the system and the information flow. It does not tells you how information is changed within the system.
- **Deployment** view focus on the component and technologies (hardware and software) that implement the system and how these interact compliant to specific system requirements.

We can also use high level use case/scenarios to show how to offer solution and derive the architecture.

In **functional/context** view, we gain overview of each components, pretty abstract, no interaction, but it tells you what the aimed/envisioned system should contain:

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215181410334.png" alt="image-20210215181410334" style="zoom:33%;" /> 

In **data/information** view, it shows what kind of data is collected, where/how it is collected, format etc.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215181824863.png" alt="image-20210215181824863" style="zoom:33%;" />

In **deployment** view, it shows what framework is being used, how data is sent etc, mostly informative.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215181928861.png" alt="image-20210215181928861" style="zoom:33%;" />

### Model and Architecture

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215182023699.png" alt="image-20210215182023699" style="zoom: 50%;" />

The model guides the architecture.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215182408237.png" alt="image-20210215182408237" style="zoom: 33%;" />

communication is important, therefore it has a separate model.

### Relations

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215182600563.png" alt="image-20210215182600563" style="zoom:50%;" />

aggregation and composition differ by the life-time of the relation, composition is more like a part-of relation, they are strongly connected. For example, leaf on the flower is composition, while flower in the pot is aggregation relation, you can feel that leaf is part of the flower, but flower is not necessarily part of the pot.

association tells you the nature of association between objects. Directed association is similar. Reflective association means that some objects within the same class is associated. The \* and $1$ in the association relation denote the one-to-many, many-to-one relation.

### Domain Model

The model consists of different elements:

- **User** can be any animated/inanimate objects
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215184051685.png" alt="image-20210215184051685" style="zoom: 33%;" />
  Here the user *is-a* human user.

- **Physical entity** can be any physical object or part of the environment that can be identified. e.g. humans, animals, rooms, stores, cars....

  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215184258571.png" alt="image-20210215184258571" style="zoom:33%;" />
  the relation shown is any-to-many (?any-to-any).

- **Virtual entity** are digital artefacts, each can be classified as active/passive. Passive entity includes database entries, active entity includes running software applications or services that may access other services or resources.
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215184603658.png" alt="image-20210215184603658" style="zoom:33%;" />
  note the virtual entity need to some how connect to a physical entity, otherwise we cannot interact with it.
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215184919996.png" alt="image-20210215184919996" style="zoom: 33%;" />
  the dash arrow are realization relationship, which means the virtual entity can be realized as active or passive artefact. Then we have the arrow that denote generalization, is-a relation. The xor here means that it is either of them but not both.

In domain model, a device is typically attached to a physical entity relates an object of the physical world to a virtual entity in the digital world of the internet. It typically categorized as:

- **sensors**: provide information, knowledge, or data about the physical entity they monitor, it ranges from identity to measurement of physical states.
- **tags**: used to identify the physical object.
- **actuators**: used to modify the physical state of the entity.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210215185548037.png" alt="image-20210215185548037" style="zoom: 33%;" />

## Lecture 3

A physical entity can be relate to a device as follows, where purple box denote a hardware and grey is unclassified.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210219173130355.png" alt="image-20210219173130355" style="zoom: 50%;" />

### Resource

A **resource** is a software component that provides the data used in actuation on the physical entities. It is distinguished as:

- **on-device**: hosted on device together with the physical entity, e.g. executable code for accessing, processing and storing sensor information and controlling actuators.
- **network**: available somewhere on the internet, e.g. backend or cloud-based databases.

### Service

A service expose resources and offer the necessary functionality for interacting with the device/resource associated with the physical entities. The relation between **resources and virtual entities** are modelled as association between **services and virtual entities**. (note service provide the resources for the virtual entities). The interaction between virtual entities and services are done via the network.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210219175111404.png" alt="image-20210219175111404" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Generic Model



<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210220145312694.png" alt="image-20210220145312694" style="zoom:50%;" />

The augmented entity is just a combine of both entities, to make things complete. Reflexive relation means that it may contain things of the same type.

### Example

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210220161400440.png" alt="image-20210220161400440" style="zoom:50%;" />

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210220161652433.png" alt="image-20210220161652433" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Information Model

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210220162958841.png" alt="image-20210220162958841" style="zoom:50%;" /> 

e.g virtual entity can be soil, attribute can be acidity/temperature/humidity, metadata may tells the format for the temperature/time etc.

- functional model capture functionalities in different concepts

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210220154831044.png" alt="image-20210220154831044" style="zoom:50%;" />

There are also service organization functional group that used for composing and orchestrating services of different levels of abstraction. It links high level requests such as the IoT Process Management Functional Group or external applications to basic services that exposes resources. e.g. translation of "give me pressure value of valve 34" to "sensor service AB".

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210220171739728.png" alt="image-20210220171739728" style="zoom:50%;" />

## Lecture 4

The Communication Functional Group abstract a variety of communication from many technologies in the IoT system and provide common interface. It is derived from the Communication Model with requirements for specific IoT system. It has to consider the followings:

- end to end path information
- addressing issues (locator/id splits)
- network management
- device specific features

Types of communication:

- **human - service**
  This is the most common type of communication, user typically interacts with services through software over the internet. It uses the standard internet-based protocol.
- **service - service**
  We have to be careful if any of the service belongs to a constrained network, for example, services deployed on constrained devices such as sensor; elements are in different subnetwork, gateway/proxy/constrained protocol should be used.
- service/device/resource interactions

The communication model define the functional components in the communication functional group of the functional model. The functional requirement includes lifetime of the device, responsiveness, robustness, sensor sampling frequency, power etc; non-functional requirements includes regulations, installation, maintenance, size and weights, cost, etc.

### Methodology

1. We first define the **objectives and requirements** of the IoT systems, 
2. Define the **Process Model Specification** with use cases of the system, 
3. Form the **domain model**, includes **PE, VE**, resources and services,
4. Define the **information model**, includes entity type, attribute name/type, metadata,
5. Produce the **service descriptions**,
6. Show how the system will be deployed using **IoT level specification**,
7. Map the IoT level specification to a **functional view**,
8. Define options with optional **view specification**.
9. Develop and **integrate** devices and components
10. **Develop** the application

### IoT system (step 6)

deployment level with increasing difficulties.

- **level 1**
  handles little, do not have significant requirements when it comes to storage/data analysis etc. e.g. smart home system.

  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222142605220.png" alt="image-20210222142605220" style="zoom:33%;" />

- **level 2**
  The system is more elaborate at this level, e.g. a smart system in a warehouse, where you may need plenty of data.

  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222143130347.png" alt="image-20210222143130347" style="zoom:33%;" />

- **level 3**
  level 2 is similar to level 3, but the analysis takes place in the cloud instead of locally (only a little) in the monitoring node.

- **level 4**

  This level has the observer node, can only observe data, e.g. allow external party to retrieve data (as observer).
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222143319547.png" alt="image-20210222143319547" style="zoom:33%;" />

- **level 5**
  Coordinator, routers/endpoints is added. The routers may be some kind of things that support some connectivity, they send their data to the coordinator which supports full 7 OSI layers which means it can connect to the internet, it may do some processing/refinement to the data before sending them to the cloud.
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222143840720.png" alt="image-20210222143840720" style="zoom:33%;" />

- **level 6**

  The controller now became centralized, like a gateway, and it is in the cloud. It takes data from the nodes and have some elaborate functionalities before sending the data to the cloud storage.
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222144100883.png" alt="image-20210222144100883" style="zoom:33%;" />

### Case Study: Home Automation System

- **step 1 objectives and requirements**
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222144435449.png" alt="image-20210222144435449" style="zoom:33%;" />

  Since data analysis is local, we know that data is little, so IoT system level 1 is enough.

- **Step 2 process model specification**
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222145939108.png" alt="image-20210222145939108" style="zoom:33%;" />

  we just translate the objectives to different attributes and state of the system.

- **step 3 domain model specification**

  - we have users such as owner of the house.
  - we have physical entities such as light bulb and room.
  - we have devices such as light level sensor, light switch actuator.
  - some service to link and send command.

  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222153148869.png" alt="image-20210222153148869" style="zoom: 33%;" />

- **Step 4 information model**
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222155226478.png" alt="image-20210222155226478" style="zoom:33%;" />

- **step 5 Produce the service descriptions**

  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222155537686.png" alt="image-20210222155537686" style="zoom: 33%;" />
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222155557242.png" alt="image-20210222155557242" style="zoom:33%;" />
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210222155735165.png" alt="image-20210222155735165" style="zoom:33%;" />

  


## Lecture 5

- **Step 6 IoT system**
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210302084213030.png" alt="image-20210302084213030" style="zoom:33%;" />

### Case Study: Weather Monitoring Station

- **Step 1**
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210302085645786.png" alt="image-20210302085645786" style="zoom:33%;" />

  We will probably have many nodes, so coordinator is probably needed, so the IoT level is about 5-6. But it also depends on the scale, as you may only want to check the weather within a small area (10 nodes then level 4 can be a good choice).

- **Step 2**
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210302085719422.png" alt="image-20210302085719422" style="zoom:33%;" />

- **Step 3**
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210302085746161.png" alt="image-20210302085746161" style="zoom:33%;" />
  Another useful device to have is the tag that represent where the sensor is.

- **Step 4**
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210302090700635.png" alt="image-20210302090700635" style="zoom:33%;" />
  The id should be there for the virtual entity, but we only have one here, so we omit it.
- **Step 5**
  <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210302091121228.png" alt="image-20210302091121228" style="zoom:33%;" />

> Part 2

### IoT Stack

IoT stack is not same as the ISO/OSI model because we need something that work across all things, so a model that is simpler and efficient is needed.

app->transport->network/ip->link->physical. (This course will focus on transport and physical layer )

internet is not generally used but this does not mean HTTP is not used. 

**Interoperability (互操作性)** is needed.

- **physical**
  we need hardware that support different standards. For example to solve bandwidth issues .

- **Link**
  we need link layer that support different communication standards.

- **network & ID**
  Support different addressing mechanism. e.g. address translation, ip4/6.

- **end-to-end**

  Here we ensure the communication between cloud and iot node is reliable. handle e.g. packets lost.

- **data**
  decide whether we allow some communication protocol to be run.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210302171055754.png" alt="image-20210302171055754" style="zoom: 33%;" />![image-20210302171558128](COMP32412.assets/image-20210302171558128.png)

### Example: Bluetooth

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210302171558128.png" alt="image-20210302171558128" style="zoom: 50%;" />

The dash line separates host device the blue-tooth device

### Communication in internet and IoT

The internet can be seem as a black box: network->gateway->internet->gateway->network. In IoT, a combination of constrained and unconstrained network should communicate, leading to highly heterogeneous networks.

Some constrained device may have high latency and low bit rate due to some policies employed on the device. Often, you will need a gateway to communicate with a constrained network.

## Lecture 6

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210303095149748.png" alt="image-20210303095149748" style="zoom:33%;" />

### Interaction models of application protocols

- request/response -> client/server
- publish/subscribe -> publisher/subscriber

most of these protocols continually evolve and may support different extent both model. web socket -> handshaking protocol.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210303095549027.png" alt="image-20210303095549027" style="zoom:33%;" />

- http1.0: one request and reply per session
- http1.1: synchronous multiple request and replies
- http2.0: asynchronous (within the TCP SYN and TCP FIN) multiple request and replies.
- coap: used by constrained application

http uses TCP, coap uses UDP.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210303100233634.png" alt="image-20210303100233634" style="zoom:33%;" />

#### Representational State Transfer Hypertext Transfer Protocol (REST HTTP)

RESTful HTTP allows devices to exchange information about their status through standardized CRUD functions. In HTTP, TCP is used in the transport layer, however, HTTP does not define any QoS (quality of service) unlike other protocols, the secure version of HTTP is HTTPS, where S stands for TLS protocol that it uses. HTTP2.0 also has new features that reduce message size, enable server push, and exchange several message over a single connection.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210303113808253.png" alt="image-20210303113808253" style="zoom:50%;" />

coap is interoperable with http, they can easily communicate with each other with a little proxy server in between.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210303114238364.png" alt="image-20210303114238364" style="zoom: 33%;" />

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210303115129208.png" alt="image-20210303115129208" style="zoom: 33%;" />![image-20210303115219575](COMP32412.assets/image-20210303115219575.png)

### Message Queuing Telemetry Transport(MQTT)

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210303115219575.png" alt="image-20210303115219575" style="zoom:33%;" />

Created for m2m communication. This protocol is in binary form, whereas HTTP is in text form.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210303115527643.png" alt="image-20210303115527643" style="zoom:33%;" />

 There are 3 levels of QoS levels, 0,1,2:

- 0 (at most once)
  deliver on the best effort basis, without confirmation on message reception

  this is the fastest

- 1 (at least once)
  assures that messages are delivered so a message confirmation is necessary
  receiver must send an acknowledgement, else publisher will send another if not received within a certain period of time.

- 2 (exactly once)
  guarantees that the message will be deliver exactly once without duplications
  this is the slowest and less appropriate for IoT.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210303121515558.png" alt="image-20210303121515558" style="zoom: 50%;" />

### Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210303121620948.png" alt="image-20210303121620948" style="zoom: 33%;" />

It has many capacities but also means that it requires more resources, processing and power.

### Websocket Protocol

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210303122718336.png" alt="image-20210303122718336" style="zoom: 50%;" />

### Summary

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210303123828049.png" alt="image-20210303123828049" style="zoom:50%;" />

The idea is to understand there two types of protocols, request/response and publish/subscribe. The challenges here are version of the protocol that under development.

#### Message size vs Message overhead

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210303124842038.png" alt="image-20210303124842038" style="zoom:50%;" />

HTTP and coap is request/response and mqtt and amqp is publish/response. HTTP is more verbose and heavy weight (e.g. large header), use HTTP to send a small measurement value of an area in warehouse is probably overkill.

## Lecture 7

 <img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210308143210468.png" alt="image-20210308143210468" style="zoom: 50%;" />

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210308143516887.png" alt="image-20210308143516887" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Case Study

The scenario:

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210308144145339.png" alt="image-20210308144145339" style="zoom:50%;" />

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210308144238982.png" alt="image-20210308144238982" style="zoom:50%;" />

They want to evaluate the protocol efficiency with Round Trip Time (RTT).

- Time needed for handshaking, packet framing, transmission via (WIFI or UART), routing...

And they have:

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210308144444378.png" alt="image-20210308144444378" style="zoom: 33%;" />

We can see that the protocol efficiency remain kind of the same for both scenario. Let see the rtt:

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210312143222986.png" alt="image-20210312143222986" style="zoom: 33%;" />

 Now lets talk about little bit of math to prepare for bluetooth and wifi topic.

### A General Communication System

A channel can be wired/wireless and we will focus on wireless channels. Communication can subject to noise, interference and losses:

Signals ideally propagate at speed of light, $c=3\times10^8 \text{metres per second}$. $c=f\lambda$, where $f$ is signal frequency and $\lambda$ is wavelength. Antennas have different size and shape and its design is important subject and active research area.

 The spectrum is very fragmented in reality, e.g. USA:

 Below show how information is transmitted in the signal view:

#### dB

It is a metric for communication power/quality. deciBell (dB) is not an SI unit but commonly used to describe the power of various features of communication systems.

It is defined as $dB=10\log_{10}\left(\frac{P_1}{P_0}\right)$, where $P_0$ is the reference power. $P_0=1\text{watt}$ then ratio is in $dBW$, $P_0=10^{-3}\text{watt}=1mW$ then the ratio is in $dBm$. It can also be used for ratios of fields, $\overset{\rightarrow}{E}$ or voltage, in this case $dB=20\log_{10}\left(\frac{V_1}{V_0}\right)$. Note you cannot just add dB, because they are logarithm.

### Wireless Ratio Channels Characteristics

Propagation path of wireless signals can vary from line-of-sight (LOS) to obstructed indoor space (OBS). It is also not stationary as the receiver may be in motion, and EM waves exhibits: reflection, diffraction and scattering mechanism.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210313114527189.png" alt="image-20210313114527189" style="zoom: 33%;" />

PL=path loss, it says path loss is directly proportional to the ratio.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210313114822955.png" alt="image-20210313114822955" style="zoom:33%;" />

GTx and GRx are the gains of the containers, lambda is the wavelength of the signal, d is the distance between Tx and Rx and L is the implementation loss as hardware is not ideal (if it is not equal to 1). if we assume L = GTx  = GRx = 1, then we have the formula at the bottom.

So if we talk about LOS in free space, we have quadratic depend loss on the distance, if your distance increase by 10 times, then you will have 20dB loss.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210313120108925.png" alt="image-20210313120108925" style="zoom:33%;" />

losses also change depending on the environment, as you can see from above chart, sigma denotes the variance.

### Reflection

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210313123214669.png" alt="image-20210313123214669" style="zoom:33%;" />

Notice that the denominator d has power of 4, which is 2 magnitude higher than the ideal case.

### Diffraction

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210314182133785.png" alt="image-20210314182133785" style="zoom:33%;" />

Sometimes the signal travel around an obstacles.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210314182303555.png" alt="image-20210314182303555" style="zoom:33%;" />

To determine how much longer the path is, we use a knife-edge model, described by the formula above. The more systematic way is to use the diffraction parameter and fresnel zones.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210314182427691.png" alt="image-20210314182427691" style="zoom:33%;" />

### Scattering

This basically describe how wave bounds on rough surface.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210314183055528.png" alt="image-20210314183055528" style="zoom:33%;" />

 So even if you calculate perfectly in a ideal scenario with reflection and diffraction, you might receive more energy than you expected, because some energy are scattered along the way in all direction.

### Signal Propagation loss

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210314184113771.png" alt="image-20210314184113771" style="zoom:33%;" />

30dB to 40dB is about tens to hundreds thousand watt loss. If we have stationary device, like in IoT system, then loss will definitely be lower.

This important formula tells you what are the trade off in communication network. bps= bits per seconds (the amount of data you can squeeze into a tunnel)

## Lecture 9

### Modulation (调幅)

To allow for higher bandwidth, longer transmission distances and manage noise, interference and losses, signals are modulated. Modulation techniques vary with the characteristics of a high frequency signal.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210325171806970.png" alt="image-20210325171806970" style="zoom:33%;" />

In order to send a signal, we need to first move our signal to some frequency that the receiver will detect, different people share different frequency, so that our signals does not get mixed up and people does not unexpectedly receive other people's signal. To do this, we need modulation, modulation is a technique that mix your signal with a certain frequency, such that the receiver can separate your frequency with other frequency, and extract your signal.

We refer to the signal that has the frequency that we want as the carrier signal (probably is the RF carrier signal in this lecture).

### Amplitude Modulation

This modulation works by encoding the signal information in the amplitude of the signal, and keeping the frequency unchanged, the signal that contains the information we want to send:
$$
s(t)=A_c \cdot \cos(2\pi f_ct+\theta(t))
$$
and the signal that contains the frequency we want to have:
$$
m(t)=A_m\cos(2\pi f_mt)
$$
then we have the signal that we actually send:
$$
S_{AM}(t)=A_c\left[1+\frac{m(t)}{A_c}\right]\cos(2\pi f_c t)
$$

If we assume the signal we want to send is the red cosine wave, then the amplitude will changes like the wave in the bottom image. Note that the frequency of the signal needs to be lower than the carrier to avoid loss. 

### Frequency Modulation

Frequency modulation is similar to amplitude modulation, but instead of changing the amplitude to encode information, we change the frequency to encode information.

### Phase Modulation

This changes both the frequency and amplitude, by shifting the angle of the carrier wave:

<img src="COMP32412.assets/Phase-modulation.gif" alt="File:Phase-modulation.gif" style="zoom: 33%;" />

in other words, we change its phase。

### PSK

Basically rotate 180 when you want to change the sending bit

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210315132558356.png" alt="image-20210315132558356" style="zoom:33%;" />

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210326113138332.png" alt="image-20210326113138332" style="zoom:33%;" />

### FSK

change the frequency when you want to change the sending bit

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210315132629107.png" alt="image-20210315132629107" style="zoom:33%;" />

### SS

You spread the signal across different frequency with lower energy. This is done because if one of the frequency is corrupted with noise, we still have other frequency that contains the information.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210326163224144.png" alt="image-20210326163224144" style="zoom:33%;" />

p(t) is a pseudo binary sequence.

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210315133500616.png" alt="image-20210315133500616" style="zoom:33%;" />

autocorrelation 自相关

<img src="COMP32412.assets/image-20210315133830961.png" alt="image-20210315133830961" style="zoom:33%;" />

imagine we have inference like the green part on the left diagram, on the receiver side, if we multiply the spectral with the pseudo random number again, the noise will likely be spread across and we ended up with a cleaner signal that has interference removed.

Another technique is to change frequency often, transmitter hop to another cleaner frequency to send data, for example, blue-tooth hops about every 600ms. This is because if some frequency is distorted by noise, then you will only stay in that frequency for limited amount of time.
