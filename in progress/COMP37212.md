## Lecture 1 Binary Images

We can think a greyscale image as a function, $I$, that given $(x,y)$, output the intensity at that position, and the digital image, is the discrete (sampled and quantized) version of this function.

Sometimes we do not care about the spatial information, just the distribution, so we have histogram:

The number of pixels determine the spatial resolution, a 512x512 is good enough most of time.

The number of grey determine the grey-level resolution (i.e. how many colours you can represents):

Image transformation as function:

Subsampling (downscale image) is also useful in some scenarios, e.g. speed up algorithms. Instead of down scaling directly, it is better to do local average pooling, this preserve the overall information.

## Lecture 2 Segmentation

Threshold can be used (histogram often used in the algorithm), but it does not work well for images like:

use adaptive thresholding would be better:

## Lecture 3 Neighbourhood Processing

Uses kernel

- **Rank filtering**

  median can remove the noise better than average. Average will blur the edge, but median preserve the edge.
