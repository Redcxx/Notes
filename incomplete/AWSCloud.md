## Module 1 Cloud Foundations Overview

### Introduction to Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the on-demand computer resource delivery via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

#### Three Cloud Models

These models provide you with different levels of control over the IT resources.

##### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Delivery the basic building blocks for cloud IT, access to networking, computers and storages.

##### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Free developers from managing the underlying hardware infrastructure (hardware and OS), allow developers to focus on deployment and management of the application.

##### Software as a Service (SaaS)

Free developers from maintaining the product, usually delivery as an end-user application. Developers only need to plan how to use it. A common example is web-based email.

#### Three Cloud Computing Deployment Models

These models represent the environments that developers' application will be deploy in.

##### Cloud

This is for cloud-based applications that fully deploys in the cloud, all parts of the application run in the cloud. It can be used on different cloud models, from low level infrastructure to high level management.

##### Hybrid

This is used to integrate cloud computing resources and existing resources that are not in the cloud. This deployment allow developers to extend their application with cloud computing while connecting to their internal system.

##### On-premise

This is sometimes called **private cloud**. It is often used for application management and virtualization to increase resource utilization. It does not provide many benefits of cloud computing.

#### Similarity with Traditional IT

| Traditional IT                                               | AWS Cloud Computing                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Firewalls, Access Control Lists (ACLs), Administrators       | AWS Security Group, Network Access Control Lists (Network ACLs), AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) |
| On-premises servers                                          | Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), Amazon Elastic Cloud Computing (Amazon EC2) |
| Direct attached storage (DAS), Storage area network (SAN), Network attached storage (NAS), Relational Database Management System (RDMS) | Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) |

#### Conclusion

With AWS services and features, developers can do almost everything that you would want in a traditional data center.
