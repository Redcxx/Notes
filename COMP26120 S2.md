# Graphs

Graph is ***nodes*** $V$ connected by ***edges*** $E \in V \times V$. A ***path*** on the graph is defined as $\forall_i=\{i\in(1,2\dots n)|(u_{i-1}, u_i)\in E\}$. **Note** that paths are ***cycle-free***.

## Directed Graphs

A directed graph is where edges are given a direction. Normally it is implemented in two ways.

### Adjacency List

Each node in the graph store its successors (the node it connects to).

| operation   | complexity |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| add edge    | $O(1)$     |
| remove edge | $O(v)$     |
| is edge     | $O(v)$     |
| successors  | $O(1)$     |
| **Memory**  | $O(v + e)$ |

### Adjacency Matrix

Have a matrix to keep track whether a pair of nodes is connected.

| operation   | complexity |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| add edge    | $O(1)$     |
| remove edge | $O(1)$     |
| is edge     | $O(1)$     |
| successors  | $O(v)$     |
| **Memory**  | $O(v^2)$   |

### Adjacency Matrix + List

| operation   | complexity |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| add edge    | $O(1)$     |
| remove edge | $O(v)$     |
| is edge     | $O(1)$     |
| successors  | $O(1)$     |
| **Memory**  | $O(v^2)$   |

## Generic Graph Traversal

### Get all nodes

````python
def explore(s):
    unexplored, explored = {s}, {}
    while found is not empty:
        to_explore = unexplored.remove_one()
        explored.add(to_explore)
        unexplored += to_explore.successors - explored
    return explored
````

- ***Breadth-first***: use *queue* for `unexplored` ---  finding shortest possible path.
- ***Depth-first***: use *stack* for `unexplored` --- topological sorting.

Note that depth-first search has a nice recursive implementation

````python
def recursive_dfs(explored, explore_node):
    if explore_node not in explored:
        explored.add(explore_node)
        for node in explore_node.successors:
            explored = recursive_dfs(explored, node)
    return explored
````

### Topological Sorting

For compiler, it needs compile the files in dependency order, if there is a cycle dependency, then it is not possible to compile the code.

```python
def recursive_dfs(explored, v):
    if v.mark is None:  # first time seeing
        v.mark = open   # denote as searching
        explored.add(v)
        for node in v.successors:
            explored = recursive_dfs(explored, v)
        v.mark = close  # mark as seem
    elif v.mark is open: 
        raise CycleDependencyError
    # else: seem and should already in explored
    return explored
```

### Shortest Path

Do a breadth-first search while maintain a predecessor map. Then use the predecessor map to find which path is the shortest given a target.
