# Short Notes
- A formula with $n$ propositional variables has $2^n$ interpretations.
- Propositional ***satisfiability*** is `NP-complete`.
- **SAT** and **3-SAT** are `NP-complete`.
- **2-SAT** is decidable in `linear` time.
- Propositional ***validity*** is `coNP-complete`.
- ***Equivalent*** checking can be *reduce* to unsatisfiability checking.
- If all occurrences of an atom `p` is *positive* then for the purpose of checking satisfiability we can replace `p` by `true`, (`false` respectively). 
- Ratio of clauses per variable is $r = m/n$ and $\pi(r, n)$ is probability of unsatisfiability which is a *monotonic* function.
- For **3-SAT**, as we increase the number of variables, the transition become *steeper* but the *crossover points* do not vary much $(\text{\textasciitilde} 4.25)$. It is hard to determine satisfiability around *crossover point*, but if it is far from *crossover point* then the problem is relatively easy to solve.
- Every propositional formula can be transformed into an equivalent ***if-else-then*** normal form.
- In ***QBF*** formula, only *free* variable matters.
- A *closed* formula is a ***QBF*** formula with no *free* variable.
- For a ***closed QBF*** formula $F$, result of $I \vDash F$, $F$ satisfiability, $F$ validity are the same.
- *Satisfiability/validity* of formulas with ***free*** variables can be reduced to checking ***truth/falsity*** of ***closed*** formulas.
- For every **transition system** $\mathbb{S}$ and state $s$ there exists a unique **computation tree** for $\mathbb{S}$ starting at $s$, up to the order of children.

# Lemmas
Monotonicity Replacement
: Polarity act as sign here, it will invert the interpretation if it is negative
: If $pol(A, π) = 1$, then $I(B) ≤ I(B')$ implies $I(A[B]π) ≤ I(A[B']π)$
: If $pol(A, π) = −1$, then $I(B') ≤ I(B)$ implies $I(A[B]π) ≤ I(A[B']π)$



# Satisfiability Checking
We often want to check if there exists a solution for a particular problem. These problems can often express as propositional formula. Thus looking for a solution becomes checking satisfiability of the corresponding propositional formula.

## Truth Table
Easiest way but grows exponentially w.r.t size of variables, which is unacceptable, problem encoded in boolean propositional formula is often huge.

## Compact Truth Table  (lec 2)

Evaluate formula based on assigning values to only subset of variables. A way to reduce size of truth table, but not enough.

<table align=center>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>subformlas</td><td>interpretations</td></tr>
    <tr><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr>
     <tr><td>variables</td><td>assignments</td>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Splitting algorithm (lec 2)
Simplify the formula, return accordingly if it is `tautology` or `contradiction`.
Assign true/false to one formula's atom, repeat from step 1, if either return `satisfiable` then return `satisfiable` else return `unsatisfiable`.
````java
procedure split(F)
parameter function select
input formula F
output satisfiable or unsatisfiable

begin
	F = simplify(F)
	if F is True: return satisifiable
	if F is False: return unsatisifiable
	p, b = select(F)
	if b is True:
		if split(F^True_p) is satisfiable:
			return satisfiable
		else:
			return split(F^False_p)
	else:
		if split(F^False_p) is satisfiable:
			return satisfiable
		else:
			return split(F^True_p)
end
````

## CNF (lec 3)
Transform satisfiability problem of formula to set of clauses. However transformation can grow exponentially. (variables connected by $\leftrightarrow$).

## [Optimised] Clausal Form (lec 3)
Introduce names for every **non-literal** sub formula. This ensure at most linear increase in size. Furthermore, if we apply two lemmas we can reduce the number of generated clauses.

Monotonic Replacement Lemma
: Let A[B]π where pol(A, π) is positive [/negative]. Then A[B]π is satisfiable if and only if A[n] ∧ (n → B)[/B → n] is satisfiable, (where n is a new variable that does not occur A[B]π).

![optimised clausal img](https://i.ibb.co/tMXwjGw/screenshot-online-manchester-ac-uk-2019-12-15-14-34-16.png)

## Unit Propagation (lec 4)

We can further reduce the size of set of clauses if there exists **unit clause** in the set as the corresponding atom must be true in order for the set of clauses to be true. This can result in **more unit clauses** thus lead to **more propagations.
## DPLL (lec 4)
We can combine unit propagation and splitting to form  a more efficient version of splitting algorithm called DPLL.
````java
procedure DPLL
input set of clauses S
output satisfiable or unsatisfiable
parameter function select

begin
	S = unit_propogation(S)
	if S is empty: return satisfiable
	if S contains empty clause: return unsatisfiable
	L = select(S)
	return DPLL({S U L}) is satisfiable ? satisfiable : DPLL({S U ¬L})
end
````
![dpll img](https://i.ibb.co/FxnmktS/screenshot-online-manchester-ac-uk-2019-12-15-16-28-48.png)

Note
: Use  $\rightarrow$ denote `select` and $\dashrightarrow$ denote `unit propogation`.

#### Optimizations
1. **Pure Literal**
	We can remove clauses containing **pure literal**. 
This may result in **more pure literals** and result in **removing more clauses**.
2. **Tautology**
	We can remove tautology clauses.

## Horn Clauses (lec 4)
If we have **a set of horn clauses**. By apply **unit propagation**:
- Result contains **empty clause** then it is **unsatisfiable**.
- Else it is **satisfiable**.
	Because every clause has **more than two literals**. That means **at least one negative literal in every clause**. Thus we can **set all other literals** to **false** to obtain a true interpretation and declare the set of horn clauses to be **satisfiable**.
> Does the opposite version of horn clauses work as well?

## GSAT (lec 5)
Sometimes for large problem we might interested in checking satisfiability within a short amount of time, thus we introduce a local search satisfiability algorithm which cannot establish unsatisfiability.
The idea is to starts with some random interpretations, flip variable optimally and try to find a satisfiability.
````java
procedure GSAT
input set of clauses S
output interpretation I satisfy S or I don't know
parameter MAX_TRIES, MAX_FLIPS

begin
	for MAX_TRIES times:
		I = random interpretation
		if I satisfy S: return I
		for MAX_FLIPS times:
			p = best flip candidate (satisfy most clauses if flipped p)
			I =	I.flip(p)
			if I satisfy S: return I
	return I don't know
end
````
![gsat img](https://i.ibb.co/M96LwwW/screenshot-online-manchester-ac-uk-2019-12-16-14-46-28.png)

## Walk SAT (WSAT) (lec 5)
Although GSAT enable us to find a solution in a large problem quickly but we may stuck in a *plateau* point during max_flips loop where further flips does not change the number of satisfying clauses. Thus an alternative arise. The idea of this approach is to randomly flip a variable in the false clause instead.
````java
procedure Walk SAT
input set of clauses S
output an I satisfy S or I don't know
parameters MAX_TRIES, MAXFLIPS

begin
	for MAX_TRIES times:
		I = random interpretation
		if I satisfy S: return I
		for MAX_FLIPS times:
			p = random variable from random false clause
			I = I.flip(p)
			if I satisfy S: return I
	return I don't know
end
````
![wsat img](https://i.ibb.co/xDxX7R0/screenshot-online-manchester-ac-uk-2019-12-16-15-02-00.png)

## GSAT with random walks (lec 5)
We can also combine the two approaches above with an extra probability parameter to decide which approach to use during the loop.
````java
procedure GSAT with random walk
input set of clauses S
output I which satisfy S or I don't know
parameters MAX_TRIES, MAX_FLIPS, probability 0 <= k <= 1

begin
	for MAX_TRIES times:
		I = random interpretation
		if I satisfy S: return I
		for MAX_FLIPS times:
			with k probability do:
				p = best flip candidate
			else:
				p = random variable from random false clause
			I = I.flip(p)
			if I satisfy S: return I
	return I don't know
end
````

## Tableau (lec 5)
Satisfiability can be represent using sign formula = 1. We can build a tableaux for signed formula and check for satisfiability by looking for open branch.
![tableau img](https://i.ibb.co/DCD0Dfd/screenshot-online-manchester-ac-uk-2019-12-16-15-38-27.png)
Assume a formula denote as $F$. We can check for *validity* if there is a *close tableau* for $F = 0$ (i.e. $F = 0$ is not possible).  Similarly we can check equivalence for any two formulas $A$ and $B$ if there is a *close tableau* for $A \leftrightarrow B = 0$ (i.e. $A \leftrightarrow B$ is always $1$) . A *fully expanded tableau* for $F = 1$ give all models of $F$.

 ## Summary

# Data Structures

We may want to reuse large propositional formula over and over again, check for properties, negation and equivalence. We need to parse the formula into some kind of compact data structure such that these operations can be easily carry out.
## Binary Decision Tree (lec 6)
By removing redundant information in the *splitting tree* one can obtain the *binary decision tree*.
![bdt img](https://i.ibb.co/JntyQ5N/screenshot-online-manchester-ac-uk-2019-12-16-16-50-57.png)

````java
procedure binary decision tree
input formula F
output the binary decision tree of F
parameter select

begin
	F = simplify(F)
	if F is true: return true
	if F is false: return false
	p = select(F)
	return tree(BDT(F_p^false), p, BDT(F_p^true))
end
````

The original formula is *forgotten* --- syntax is lost but semantic is preserved. Two formulas with the same binary decision tree is guaranteed to be equivalent. 

**Properties**
- Worst case exponential size.
- Interpretation checking can be done in *linear* in number of variables.
- Satisfiability/Validity checking can be done in *linear* in tree size.
- Equivalent/Some operations(e.g. conjunction) are hard to check/implement.


## If-Else-Then Normal Form (lec 6)
We can easily convert *binary decision tree* to *if-else-then* normal form.
![if else then img](https://i.ibb.co/F7WJ05h/screenshot-online-manchester-ac-uk-2019-12-16-16-54-37.png)
## Binary Decision Diagram (lec 6)
Binary decision tree are not good enough, many operations are hard to implement and it is not compact.
It contains redundant tests and isomorphic subtree. Here we first make it compact by transforming BDT to Binary Decision Diagram (BDD).
![bdd](https://i.ibb.co/ZTNXgn1/screenshot-online-manchester-ac-uk-2019-12-16-17-13-33.png)
Now the representation is compact, **satisfiability** and **validity** checking can be done in **constant** time.
**Note**: when transforming, use a *bottom up* approach.

## Order Binary Decision Diagram (lec 6)
Although we successfully solved the compact problem, but **equivalent** checking and some boolean operations such as **conjunction** are still hard to implement. We solve these two problems by converting BDD to Order Binary Decision Diagram (OBDD)
The main problem of BDD is that different branch can do test on different variable. Thus we introduce an *order* into the diagram (e.g. $P > Q > R$).

Now the diagram has more properties:
: *Equivalence*/*satisfiability*/*validity* can be check in **constant** time.
: Many boolean operations are *easy to implement*.

Now we have an OBDD which has nice properties, but often we have many formulas and we would like to combine them and check its properties, to do that we need to define a few more operations.

#### Integrating node into a dag

````java
procedure integrate
input node n1, variable p, node n2
output a node in modified D representing if p then n1 else n2
parameter global dag D

begin
	if n1 == n2: return n1  // value of p does not matter
	node = tree(n1, p, n2)
	D.add_if_absent(node)
	return node
end
````

#### Integrating formula into a dag
We make node representing the formula and use `integerate()` function above
````java
procedure OBDD
input formula F
output a node in modified D representing F
parameter global dag D

begin
	// base case: tautology or contradiction
	F = simplify(F)
	if F is true: return 1
	if F is false: return 0
	// recursive case: 
	// build a tree representing formula F
	// then integrate into global dag D bottom up
	p = max_variable(F)
	left = OBDD(F_p^false)
	right = OBDD(F_p^true)
	return integrate(left, p, right, D)
end
````

#### Integrate nodes as disjunction/conjunction into a dag
Sometimes we want to integrate formulas as disjunction/conjunction into a global dag, we can make nodes representing these formula then integrate them as follows.
````java
procedure disjunction_conjunction
input k nodes representing k formulas
output a node in modified D representing disjunction_conjunction of input nodes
parameter global dag D

begin
	// a tautology in disjunction make disjunction tautology
	// a contradiction in conjunction make conjunction contradiction
	if nodes.contains(1_0): return 1_0
	// skip contradiction/tautology, irrevelent
	if nodes.contains(0_1): return disjunction_conjunction(nodes.remove_all(0_1))
	p = nodes.max_variable()
	lefts, rights = [], []
	// split node containing current order variable
	for node in nodes:
		if node.val is p:
			lefts.add(node.left)
			rights.add(node.right)
		else:
			lefts.add(node)
			rights.add(node)
	// lefts representing obdd's path when p (max var) is false
	// rights now representing obdd's path when p (max var) is true
	left = disjunction_conjunction(lefts)
	right = disjunction_conjunction(rights)
	return integrate(left, p, right, D)
end
````

## Quantified Boolean Formula (lec 7 & 8)
Sometimes we would like some of the variable having some kind of properties, sometimes we do not care what value is eventually assigned to the formula, as long as we have an assignment that satisfy the formula. Thus we add some quantification to our variable in the formula, here we include two operators: $\forall$ and $\exists$ (e.g. $p \to \forall q \exists p\left( q \leftrightarrow p \right) \lor r$).

#### Rectified Formula
Sometimes we would like to substitute parts of the formula to check for properties without changing other parts of the formula. But we cannot directly substitute variables because we have given some special properties to part of them (*bounded*). So we need to give different names to distinguish *bound* and *free* variables, so that when we substitute we only make changes to variables with same properties. Formulas which we can freely substitute formulas are called **rectified**.

#### Jointly Rectified Formulas

A set of formulas S is *jointly rectified* if 
- A variable is *free* then so it is in all formulas. 
- There is only one occurrence of any quantifiers in formulas.

####  Prenex Form

A formula is in *prenex form* if all *quantifiers* are in front of the formula.
We can convert any *QBF* to its *prenex* form.
![prenx rules img](https://i.ibb.co/THW9BbL/screenshot-online-manchester-ac-uk-2019-12-17-16-43-35.png)
![prenex conversion example img](https://i.ibb.co/f04C9zy/screenshot-online-manchester-ac-uk-2019-12-17-16-52-53.png)  ![prenex conversion example img2](https://i.ibb.co/MGJ3zLy/screenshot-online-manchester-ac-uk-2019-12-17-16-56-39.png)

#### Apply Algorithms on QBF
- **Pure Atom Elimination**
If an atom ***p*** is pure then,
	- There exists an assignment for ***p*** so that ***p*** will be true so if it is existentially quantified then all clauses containing ***p*** can be removed.
	- There exists an assignment for ***p*** so that ***p*** will be false so if it is universally quantified then ***p*** can be removed from all clauses.

- **Universal Literal Deletion**
For any non-tautology clause. If there exists a universal quantified literal $l$ such that all existential literals is quantified before $l$, then $l$ can be removed without changing the result. This is because
	- If any *existential literal* is ***true*** then the clause is ***true*** regardless of $l$.
	- If all *existential literals* is ***false***, then the leftover $l$ will be false as it is universally quantified. 
- **Unit Propagation**
Given a variable, if it is ***universally quantified***, then the set of clauses is ***false***, else just carry out normal unit propagation.

- **Implementations**
````java
// for splitting and DPLL
// after select
switch(alg(F_b^false), q):
	case (true, E):
		return true
	case (false, E):
		return alg(F_b^true)
	case (true, A):
		return alg(F_b^true)
	case (false, A):
		return false			

// for OBDD
// after select and split nodes into left (l) and right (r)
if EA_quants.contains(p):
	// existential quantified means either negative or positive will work,
	// universal quantified means both negative and positive must work,
	// so we add both side either case
	return EA_quant(E_quants.remove(p), set(l + r)) 
// normal variable, so carry out usual task
left = EA_quant(E_quant, l)
right = EA_quant(E_quant, r)
return integrate(left, p, right, D)	
````
- **Splitting**
	![qbf splitting img](https://i.ibb.co/QJ5W64v/screenshot-online-manchester-ac-uk-2019-12-1.png)
- **DPLL**
	![qbf dpll img](https://i.ibb.co/NYDhGb0/screenshot-online-manchester-ac-uk-2019-12-2.png)

**Note**
$\forall$-quantification output node representing conjunctions
$\exists$-quantification output node representing disjunctions
The only thing we need to change is ***base case*** and function ***name***.


# States Changing System
## Finite Domains (lec 9)
> Propositional Logic for Finite Domain (PLFD)

Often in real world, ***true*** and ***false*** are often not enough to representing states and we may want to assign different range of values to different variables. However, we can always transform logic with more states into boolean propositional logic.
Here we introduce some notations. The set of values we can assign to a variable is called ***finite domain***, it must be ***non-empty*** and ***finite***. 
If we have a variable ***x*** then $dom(x)$ represents the ***finite domain*** of ***x***, this implies $x \in dom(x)$.

## PLFD $\rightarrow$ Propositional Logic
Let say we have a PLFD formula $F$.


1. Replace old variables, let $x = v$ be $x_v$, denote replaced formula as $F_{prop}$.
2. Limit variables to their domains, for example, limiting variable $x$ to its domain $\{v_1 \dots v_n\}$, denote as $D_x$.
$$\underbrace{\overset{at\ least\ one\ within\  domain\ values}
{\overbrace{(x_{v_1} \lor \dots \lor x_{v_n	})}} \land \overset{can't\ have\ two\ at\ the\ same\ time}{\overbrace{\underset{i<j}{\huge{\land}}(\neg x_{v_i}\lor \neg x_{v_j})}}}_{exactly \ one\  from\ the\ domain\ for\ variable\ x}$$
3. We need to do this for ***every*** variable, denote as $D_{all}$.
$$D_{all} = D_{x_1} \land \dots \land D_{x_n}$$
4. The original PLFD formula $F$ is *satisfiable* ***if and only if*** the propositional formula $D_{all} \land F_{prop}$ is *satisfiable*.

For example, let $x$ has domain range $\{a, b, c\}$ and we interested in checking satisfiability of 
$$\neg (x = b \lor x = c)$$
Then this is ***equivalent*** to check satisfiability of following boolean propositional formula
$$(x_a \lor x_b \lor x_c) \land (\neg x_a \lor \neg x_b) \land (\neg x_a \lor \neg x_c) \land (\neg x_c \lor \neg x_b) \land \\ \neg(x_b \lor x_c)$$

## Algorithm for PLFD

### Tableau
![tableau plfd img](https://i.ibb.co/kJWg33Q/screenshot-online-manchester-ac-uk-2019-12-23-15-09-27.jpg)

## Finite State Transition System
We want a way to model system which change state from one and another so that we can check properties of the system. Thus we build a **transition system**. We define transition system as follows.
$$\mathbb{S} = \{S, ln, T, X, dom\}$$
$X$ and $dom$ define a **PLFD** where $X$ is a set of variables and $dom$ is the domain of the variables. Let's denote all possible interpretations of $X$ as $\mathbb{I}$.
$S \subseteq \mathbb{I}$ is a *non-empty* set of ***states***.
$ln \subseteq S$ is a *non-empty* set of ***initial states***.
$T \subseteq S \times S$ is a set of pairs of ***transition relations***.
We call this transition system finite because for every variable $x \in X$, $dom(x)$ is finite.

## Computation Tree and Paths
Now we have a transition system, we may want to investigate properties such as ensure that there is no path from a starting state $s$ such that it leads to some unwanted states $s'$. Thus we introduce **computation tree** to find all possible paths of our system.

Let $\mathbb{S}$ be a finite state transition system, we introduce ***nodes*** as the states in $S$ and a **computation tree** starting at a state $s$ called ***root***. Then we expand the root by stating for every node $n$ in the tree, its children are nodes $n''$ from $(n', n'') \in T$.

A ***computation path*** is any branch of the computation tree.

> If a transition system have multiple initial states does it has more than one root? 

## Linear Temporal Logic

We have all possible paths of a **transition system**, we can use ***linear temporal logic*** to investigate some properties of a given **computation path**. 
- $\square$: always in the future.
- $\lozenge$: eventually in the future.
- $\bigcirc$: next.
- $F\ \bold{\Large u}\ G$: $F$ has to hold before $G$ is ***true***, which must happen at current or future.
- $F\ \bold{R}\ G$: $G$ has to hold before & includes $F$ is ***true***. If $F$ never hold then $G$ is always ***true***.

### Equivalences
- $\neg \bigcirc F \equiv \bigcirc \neg F$
- $\neg \lozenge F \equiv \square \neg F$
- $\neg \square F \equiv \lozenge \neg F$
- $\neg (A\ \bold{\Large u}\ B) \equiv \neg A\ \bold{R}\ \neg B$
  - RHS $\equiv {\ \ \ A\ \ \ A\ \dots\ \ A\ ¬A \atop{¬B¬B\dots¬B¬B} }\}$ ensured $B$ is false when first $¬A$ appeared, this break $\bold{\Large{u}}$'s until property.
  - If $¬A$ never appear then does not satisfy $\bold{\Large{u}}$'s must happen property either.
### LTL with $\bold{\Large u}$ and $\bigcirc$ has the same expressive power as LTL
- $\lozenge F \equiv \top\ \bold{\Large u}\ F$ 
- $\square A \equiv\neg(\top\ \bold{\Large u}\ \neg A)$
- $A\ \bold{R}\ B \equiv \neg(\neg A\ \bold{\Large u}\ \neg B)$

### Unwinding Properties
- $\lozenge F \equiv F\ \lor\ \bigcirc\lozenge F$
- $\square F \equiv F\ \land\ \bigcirc\square F$
- $A\ \bold{\Large{u}}\ B \equiv B\ \lor\ (A\ \land\ \bigcirc(A\ \bold{\Large{u}}\ B))$
- $A\ \bold{R}\ B \equiv B \land (A\ \lor\ \bigcirc(A\ \bold{R}\ B))$

#### Precedence
![ltl precedence img](https://i.ibb.co/cDqDVq7/screenshot-online-manchester-ac-uk-2019-12-24-15-30-50.png)

Note
: If we want to show two **LTL** formulas are not *equivalent* then we present a *path* which satisfy one but not the other.
: We may also want to consider the problem: does a **LTL** formula holds for all paths or only some of it?

  - Empty clause: num_var = 0, it is horn and both positve and negative polarity.
  - Unit clause: num_var = 1.
  - Horn clause: at most 1 positive literal.

We see that there is a sharp threshold transition of $\pi = m/n$ from sat to unsat with *crossover point* $\backsimeq 4.25$

# Extras

## Russian Spy
There are three people **A B C**, 2 Germans **G**, 1 Russian spy **R**: <br>$(RA \land GB \land GC) \lor (GA \land RB \land GC) \lor (GA \land GB \land RC)$
Russian is **Spy**:
$(RA \rightarrow SpyA) \land (RB \rightarrow SpyB) \land (RC \rightarrow SpyC)$
**A** is as German as **B** is Russian
$GA \leftrightarrow RB$
hidden: Russian is not German
$(RA \leftrightarrow ¬GA) \land (RB \leftrightarrow ¬GB) \land (RC \leftrightarrow ¬GC)$
we need to show **C** is not a Russian spy
$RC \land SpyC$
$\therefore$ If set of formulas is not satisfiable, then Person C cannot be a Russian Spy

## Sudoku

Introduce $9 \times 9 \times 9 = 729$ variables , use $V_{rcd}$ to represent board $V$ at row $r$ and column $c$ contains digit $d$.
**Each cell contains at least 1 digit**
$\left( V_{rc1} \vee  \dots \vee V_{rc9}\right)$
**Each cell contains at most 1 digit**
$\left( \neg V_{rc1} \vee \neg V_{rc2}\right) \wedge \left( \neg V_{rc1} \vee \neg V_{rc3}\right) \wedge \dots \wedge \left( \neg V_{rc8} \vee \neg V_{rc9}\right)$
**Every row must contain different digits**
$\{ \neg V_{r',c,d} \vee \neg V_{r',c,d}\  |\  r, r', c, d \in \{ 1, \dots, 9 \}, c < c' \}$
**Every column must contain different digits**
$\{ \neg V_{r,c,d} \vee \neg V_{r,c',d}\  |\  r, c, c', d \in \{ 1, \dots, 9 \}, c < c' \}$
**Every 3x3 square must contain one of each digits**
similar.
**Finally we add initial configuration**
e.g. $V_{129}$.

$\therefore$ If the set of formulas is satisfiable then the given sudoku with initial config has a solution.

## Loop the Loop
We first number the rows and columns.
Let $V_{ij}$ be there is a vertical line between $node_{ij}$ and $node_{ij+1}$
Let $H_{ij}$ be there is a horizontal line between $node_{ij}$ and $node_{ij+1}$
Then we can encode exactly $n$ lines around a number $p$ like 
$T_{=n}(v_{15}, v_{25}, h_{15}, h_{25})$
**However, there is no simple way of expressing single loop in propositional logic**
