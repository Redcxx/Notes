### The network is reliable

Someone went to cut the fibra wire before.

### Latency is zero

If the latency in some time increased and exceeded the timeout in your application, then all network requests using that timeout will fail. It is more like the physics limit.

### Bandwidth is infinite

With more money you can have more bandwidth, but you do not have infinite amount of money.

### Topology does not change

If you write scripts assume there is only 2 servers and you add more servers in the future, or one of the servers is down, boom, your application maybe messed up.
