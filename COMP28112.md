## Definition

An network of hardware / software running independently, communicate and coordinate their actions only by passing messages.

### Consequences

#### Concurrency

Components can do their own work and share resources only when necessary, The capacity of system handling more resources can be increased by adding more components. The coordination of the components is an important topic // TODO

#### No global clock

Components need to coordinate their action, this is often depend on the time but the only way components can exchange messages is by passing message. This result in limited accuracy. // TODO

#### Independent Failures

All computer systems can fail, in distributed computing, components fail individually and other components is responsible for handling such error and continue running.

### Examples

#### Web Search

There are over 1.74billion websites on the internet (Jan 2020), searching through such massive index requires many technology.

- A very large number of networks of computers located at data centers around the world.
- The associated distributed data (file) system heavily optimized for large data search.
- The associated storage system which required fast access to large dataset.
- A lock service that offers distributed locking and agreements.
- A efficient computational model for very large parallel and distributed computing.

#### Massive Multiple-player Online Games (MMOGs)

As of Sep 2019, League of Legends has over 8 million concurrent players at peak. A geographically distributed servers is needed to ensure low response time for players to have a good experience

##  8 Fallacies of distributed computing.

### The network is reliable

Someone went to cut the fibre wire before. We cannot assume network is always reliable, we need to care about error handling, else you may wait infinite amount of time waiting for a failed computer to response and permanently consuming computer memory or other resources.

### The network is secure

Big companies lost tons of records in the past few years... We cannot assume network is secure and some form of protection is needed.

### Latency is zero

There is latency in transport, and it comes with pack loss. If you assume there is unbounded traffic then you may waste bandwidth and cause lots of packet loss.

### Bandwidth is infinite

With more money you can have more bandwidth, but you do not have infinite money. Assuming bandwidth is infinite can result in bottlenecks.

### Topology does not change

If you write scripts assume there is only 2 servers and you add more servers in the future, or one of the servers is down, boom, your application maybe messed up. It can also result in changes of latency and bandwidth which cause similar problems.

### There is one administrator

The senders must be aware that there are multiple administrators and they can have conflicting policies in order to complete their desired path.

### Transport cost is zero

Transport requires money and are non-negligible,  it needs to be noted in budgets to avoid vast shortfalls.

### Network is homogenous

This assume that computers in the network uses similar configurations and protocols which can cause similar problems as the first three fallacies: *network is secure*, *latency is zero* and *bandwidth is infinite*.

# Miscellaneous

### Heartbleed

Heartbleed is a security bug in the OpenSSL cryptography library, which is a widely used implementation of the ***Transport Layer Security*** (**TLS**). It is introduced in the software in 2012, publicly fixed and disclosed in May 2014. The bug is caused by missing bounds check in the implementation in the TLS ***heartbeat*** *(thus the name heartbleed)* extension and belong to kind of buffer-overflow attack.
