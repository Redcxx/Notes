Software engineering is building software ***to the budge*** ***by the deadline*** that ***sufficient return on investment*** and ***cheap to maintain and change*** in the future.

Code Reading

- top down, overall -> fill details
- bottom up, individuals --> forms picture

Testing 

- Unit Test
- Functional Test
- Integration Test

Debugging

- start

  - run code, understand the expected and observe
  - note that cannot replicate does not mean there is no error

- stabilize

  - narrow the problem as specific as possible

- isolate

  - brute force --- walk through the code
  - back tracking --- walk back from the error code
  - consider from architectural point of view
  - binary search --- try to find the middle of the error and repeat
  - cause elimination --- identify as many cause as we can and eliminate them until we are certain what's happening

  - print statement, explain the code to someone else, minimise execution path, online debugger, test case, git commits and git blame, profiling

- fix

- test

- look for similar errors.

Adding new feature is a risk for large system, lots of users and in active use.

we need to control risk and minimise regression

- feature scoping and incremental release.

Test against 3 layers architecture

- representation logic --- client
- business logic --- manager & controller
- data logic --- game state, database

Test with dependency, A depends on B

- test A without B --- use stub
- test B without A use driver

Test without code's existence

- write test as if they exists
- decide what a perfect production code would be like

Failing Test is not a problem only if the feature has not been implemented fully

Test First Development

- avoid regression
- do not forget to write test
- more importantly, it forces us to do client-centred design

Git

- git add: add changes to index
- git commit: add a snapshot of the status after index changes
- git reflog: show activity history
- git reset: move head to specific commits --- leave no trace and modification, for minimal and curated history
  - soft/default: update index
  - hard: update index and working tree
- git revert: undo changes by creating a new commit that revert the changes

Git workflows

- master: production code (every commit here should deployable)
- develop: development code (test branch here before merging)
  - trunk base development: should be short, clean and ephemeral
- (supporting) feature branch (use pull request for merging)
- (supporting) hotfix branch
- (supporting) release branch

It is popular but still complex model

Code changes: 1) fix bug. 2) add features. 3) migration/refactor

Refactor examples

- rename
- change data type
- change code structure/context

Refactor process

- run tests to ensure good state
- migrate tests to fit new code
- migrate the code/functionality graduate-ly
- fix errors
- old tests can be removed

**Testability** is a non-functional requirement which means code are easy to put under a test. Design for testability means we make sure we can easily test what we build and let this idea drive the design of the production code.

It is hard to test if there is

- non-deterministic code
- hard-coded behaviour
- not allow inheritance/overriding
  - static code
  - constructor
- complex/slow configuration
- breaking **law of demeter**
  - principle of least knowledge
  - work on what you have
  - talk to immediate friends only

**Test double** is a version of the production code that is predictable/controllable in a way that helps when writing tests

- dummies: pass around but not actually needed, use to fill parameter list
- stubs: provide canned answers to calls during tests
- fakes: have a working implementation, but can use "shortcut" to compare to production code.
- mock: object which define the expected behaviours to compare indirect output.
  - used to control certain aspects of a class behaviour, for example fix return value
  - verify that certain expectation occurs.

*Code have two client from day one --- user and tests*, so we need to write reusable and easy to change code

Design Pattern

patterns are ***reusable design solution***

they provide reusable solutions which worked in the past and provide common vocabulary for talking about software design

- name
- structure
- intent
- implementation
- motivation
- applicability

each pattern can be categorise as

- creation: best way of object creation process given a situation
- structural: composite of objects/classes
- behavioural: interaction between objects and responsibilities/behaviours distribution.

- composite: use inheritance when you spot tree like structure
- adapter: provide required interface for legacy code (wrap incoming request to another call)
- factory: a class which job is to create instance, useful when lots of subclasses
- singleton: ensure class only have instance, no constructor available outside, access through method which return the same instance every time

consider refactoring towards a design pattern to prevent over-engineering, avoid using design pattern simply and consider if it make your code easier to understand, maintain and modify.

Software Risk

An event which can have negative effect on the software, it may but haven't happen.

Need to estimate likelihood and cost of risk, not all risk are equally worrisome.

Contingency Planning --- plan on what to do if severe risk occur, so that we know what to do when it happens and can set aside enough resources for it.
