# Glossary

#### Analogue Signal

Voltage against time.

#### Harmonic

A harmonic of a wave is a wave with a frequency that is a positive integer multiple of the frequency of the original wave, known as the fundamental frequency. For example, if the fundamental frequency is 50 Hz, the frequencies of the first three higher harmonics are 100 Hz (2nd harmonic), 150 Hz (3rd harmonic), 200 Hz (4th harmonic) and any addition of waves with these frequencies is periodic at 50 Hz. It is a single note vibrating produce other notes with higher frequency.

#### Octave

An octave is the interval between two musical notes where one is double frequency of the other. For example, if a note has frequency of 220Hz, then 440Hz is one octave above and 110Hz is one octave below.

#### Frequency

Frequency is the number of times an event repeat for a unit of time.

#### Period

Period is the duration of one cycle of the repeating event.

# Introduction

Mobile phones are popular nowadays, but it was not easy to create. At the beginning, there is no mobile phone, just computers, which use general purpose processors, it consumes lots of power and not suitable for smaller device, so a mobile system is needed...

A mobile phone/tablet typically includes

- Processors (RISC)

- Memory

  Internal

  - **ROM** by manufacturer
  - **Flash Memory** slow, huge, non-volatile
  - **DRAM** fast, smaller, volatile, need refresh
  - **SRAM** faster, smaller, volatile, no need refresh but complex & expensive 

  External

  - SD card/USB

- Screens, mic, buttons, speakers...

- Ratio communications interface

- Antenna

- Battery

Techniques

- Phone calls using cellular network / wifi network
- Data / Internet access
- Satellite communication (GPS)
- Images & Sound capture, storages & comms
- Bluetooth & Near Field Comms (NFC)

**Note** that more **RAM** does not mean it is better because ***it uses more power*** regardless of what is in it.

# Analogue & Digital signals

An important (used to be) function of phone is to make calls. This means that we need to transmit sound, so we want a way to represent and "store" sound. The common way to represent sound is through a analogue signal which is just voltage against sound, but in order to store it, we have to convert it to some number, we do it by sampling.

### Sampling

Sampling is basically measure the voltage at regular interval. If we collect 2 samples per seconds, then the sampling frequency (Hz / fs) is 2. You may think that we lose some fidelity but according to the sampling theorem, if our sampling frequency is more than twice the highest frequency component then we lose nothing --- that is, reconstruct the exact same waveform.

### [Quantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(signal_processing))

The number of bits we use to store each sample will affect the sound because it determine the quality of each sample. For example, if we only have 3 bits available, then our sound will be limited in integer of range -4 to 3. This introduce quality degradation called quantization noise.

### [Aliasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing)

It is an effect cause by sampling sound at a frequency less than twice the highest frequency component. Aliasing is generally avoided by applying low pass filters or anti-aliasing filters (AAF) to the input signal before sampling and when converting a signal from a higher to a lower sampling rate.

# Miscellaneous

#### Decibel (dB)

It is the power ratio of two sound. It is calculated as 10 * log ratio:

$$dB = 10 \times \log_{10}(\frac{\text{sound}}{\text{reference}})$$

#### Energy

***Joule*** is the unit of energy (= 1 newton meter), 1 Joule is about the energy needed to raise an apple by 1 meter. ***Watt*** is the unit of power, it measures joule per second.
