# Introduction

Mobile phones are popular nowadays, but it was not easy to create. At the beginning, there is no mobile phone, just computers, which use general purpose processors, it consumes lots of power and not suitable for smaller devices, but it is needed for doing complicated stuff, so a mobile system is needed...

A mobile phone/tablet typically includes

- Processors (RISC)

- Memory

  Internal

  - **ROM** by manufacturer
  - **Flash Memory** slow, huge, non-volatile
  - **DRAM** fast, smaller, volatile, need refresh
  - **SRAM** faster, smaller, volatile, no need refresh but complex & expensive 

  External

  - SD card/USB

- Screens, mic, buttons, speakers...

- Ratio communications interface

- Antenna

- Battery

Techniques

- Phone calls using cellular network / wifi network
- Data / Internet access
- Satellite communication (GPS)
- Images & Sound capture, storages & comms
- Bluetooths & Near Field Comms (NFC)

**Note** that more **RAM** does not mean it is better because ***it uses more power*** regradless of what is in it.

## Breakdown

In this course we will study

- Features of mobile system including smartphones.
- Representing signals in smartphones.
- Coding & decoding & compression.
- Android app
- Mobile comms
- Maximising battery life

# Sampling

Sound is recorded

# Miscellaneous

#### Energy

***Joule*** is the unit of energy (= 1 newton meter), 1 Joule is about the energy needed to raise an apple by 1 meter. ***Watt*** is the unit of power, it measures joule per second.
