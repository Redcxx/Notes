- Semester 1: [Email Jonathan](mailto:jonathan.l.shapiro@manchester.ac.uk?subject=AI and Games Query)

- 30% first-semester project

  - 15% approach - clever idea

    - **Good understanding of the methods used:**

      We don't want you to produce a course on what we taught you. We want to see evidence in what you implement and what decisions you make that you understand the methods you are using.

    - **Use of the literature:**
      Was the system you built and the choices you made informed by work found in established literature

    - **Use of evidence and experiments:**

      Did you do careful testing or comparative tests to choose parameters, evaluate approaches, etc. Did you show us the outcomes of these?

    - **Effective implementation:**

      Did you optimise the representation, the tree search, use parallelization, or use some other optimizations?

  - 15% performance

    - 11.25% wins

        Any bot which could in principle win games (i.e. it plays correctly) gets a mark in this range. The mark is in proportion to the fraction of games won. A bot which wins half of its games gets a mark of ![$ 70\%$](http://syllabus.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/2020/COMP34120/MarkingScheme2020/img13.png). A bot which could win a game but loses every game will get a mark of ![$ 50\%$](http://syllabus.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/2020/COMP34120/MarkingScheme2020/img11.png) (i.e. plays correctly, but extremely poorly). A bot which wins all of its games will get a mark of ![$ 90\%$](http://syllabus.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/2020/COMP34120/MarkingScheme2020/img12.png).

      - **Extra credit:**

        Up to ![$ 10\%$](http://syllabus.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/2020/COMP34120/MarkingScheme2020/img14.png) marks can be awarded for an exceptionally well-thought out or novel approach. If a bot is faster than bots of similar win performance, or is better then many bots in *both* win performance and speed performance, it can gain marks here.

    - 3.75% speed

        Any bot which could in principle win games (i.e. it plays correctly) gets a mark in this range. The mark is in proportion to the rank of the speed. A bot with the median speed gets a mark of ![$ 70\%$](http://syllabus.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/2020/COMP34120/MarkingScheme2020/img13.png); the fastest which can in principle win a game gets ![$ 90\%$](http://syllabus.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/2020/COMP34120/MarkingScheme2020/img12.png); the slowest gets ![$ 50\%$](http://syllabus.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/2020/COMP34120/MarkingScheme2020/img11.png).

      - **Extra credit:**

        Up to ![$ 10\%$](http://syllabus.cs.manchester.ac.uk/ugt/2020/COMP34120/MarkingScheme2020/img14.png) can be added to the mark. Often the run-times range over two or three orders of magnitude, which is not captured in the rank. Extra credit can be given to bots which are much faster than those of similar rank or similar win performance.

Reading is not optional extra and should be the main activity, Ask in synchronous sessions

- 3 written coursework
  - first formative
  - second and third summative (third is tougher but they are equally weighted)

### Structure & Organisation

- Weekly workshops 
  - 2 hours of “synchronous” activities 
  - Structured input and exploratory activities. 
  - A blend of
    - Brief presentations (micro-lectures, 10-15 min, recorded) 
    - Hands-on activities (5-10 min) 
    - Discussion of materials and homework tasks (There will be some up-front material to read)
  - No single style or balance: some individual/group work, some trying of software, some discussions (polls), quizzes. 
  - Via zoom (Meeting ID: 985 3662 8429; Passcode: COMP38211)

- Weekly laboratories 
  - 1 hour of “synchronous” activities 
  - Weekly timetabled hands-on sessions for trying out new systems or techniques (set tasks, known answers). 
    - Preparation for course work 
  - Opportunity to ask questions about the set tasks with more open ended/specific discussions and feedback
    - Working towards your coursework submission 
  - Via the same zoom 
    - Break-out rooms for specific discussions

### Assessment

- Summative: 100% coursework 
  - Design, implementation and analysis/discussion 
    - CW submissions will involve both code and discussion of issues. 
    - Needed: Linux, Java, Eclipse, Hadoop

    -  due November 24th (Week 8) 
  - Course work 2 - Data indexing (weight 0.4)
    - due January 15th 2021 (Week 12)
