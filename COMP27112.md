# Glossary

#### Primitives

basic elements of graphics input (point, line, text, circle...)

#### [Fragments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragment_(computer_graphics))

The data needed to generate a single pixel's worth of drawing primitive in the data buffer *(a portion in RAM that drives video display)*. These data includes raster positions, depth, interpolated attributes, alpha, window ID... A fragment ***maybe discarded*** if it is farther away from a another pixels (according to depth buffer), a fragment ***can replace another pixel*** if it is nearer than what is already there and it can also be replace with ***mixture of fragment's color and existing pixel's color*** if alpha blending is used.

#### [Pixels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel)

Pixel is the smallest controllable unit in a raster image. Each pixel is a ***sample*** of the original image, the more samples we have, the more accurate presentation of the original image.

#### [Raster Image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics) (栅格)

It is a dot matrix data structure to represent a (usually) rectangular grid of pixels.

# OpenGL

It is an API for doing 3D computer graphics. It stands for Open Graphics Library, it is designed to be ***cross platform***, ***language independent*** and ***extensible***. Origins in Silicon Graphics Inc and ***first release in 1992***, now run by **Khronos Group** *(This name is tested in quiz)* and is a open standard for portable graphics programming. Its members include many companies but not Microsoft --- they have **DirectX**.

- Point: regular (square) and anti-aliased (circle)
- Lines: consists of geometry (shape) and attributes (appearance)
- Polygons: quadrilaterals, triangle and convex polygons
- Transformations
- Camera Model --- 2D view of 3D scene
- Hidden surface removal
- lighting
  - local methods: flat, gouraud and phong (this gives shining which often what we want)
- Modelling & Rendering: model + shading + texture
- Blending & Transparency
- Support libraries
  - GLU: wrap low level details such as curves and surfaces and provides utilities such as viewing, texturing and tessellation
  - GLUT: interactions such as simple menu system and primitives such as cone and sphere

**Note** that OpenGL uses 4 x 4 matrix to encode 3D transformation.

# Miscellaneous

## [Vector Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics)

Vector graphics are computer graphics images defined in term of 2D points. These points are connected by lines and curves to form many other shapes. Each point has a defined position and determine direction of path, path has various properties such as thickness and color.

#### [Vector Monitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_monitor)

In the early days vector monitor is used to display graphics. it is a type of CRT ([Cathode-Ray Tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode-ray_tube)). It consists of some electron guns which shoot electrons to a monitor made of [special material](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorescence) which does not immediately re-emit radiation it absorbs and glows (it is used make stuffs glow in dark as well).

## History

### Display

During 1950s, people use **Vector CRT display** to create image, it uses electron beam to draw lines and texts and nothing else. Those images fades out almost immediately and required to redraw repeatedly. Nowadays we use **Raster graphics displays** --- 2D array of pixels to display images. Pixels are **approximation** of the real images, the more samples we have the higher fidelity (保真度). 

**Note** that everything in graphics are just approximation, but some are better than others.

### Mesh Data Structure

$f \overset{index\ into}{\rightarrow} e \overset{index\ into}{\rightarrow} v$

- vertex list
- edge list
- face list

### 3D Model Pipeline

1. 3D Vertex
2. Model Transformation
3. Viewing Transformation
4. Projection Transformation
5. Clip to view volume
6. Perspective Division
7. Viewport Transformation
8. 2D Pixels

### Graphics Pipeline

1. Model & View Transformation
2. Lighting (Gouraud / Phong)
3. primitive assembly (clipping)
4. Rasterization (aka scan conversion)
5. Fragment Operation (blending / depth test / surface removal)

Note that in Programmable pipeline, 1 and 2 are replaced by vertex shader program and 4 is replaced by fragment shader program. They must be provided by the user and written in shading language such as GLSL.

### Fixed vs Programmable Pipeline

- Fixed pipeline is deprecated, new stuff cannot be added, but it is easy to learn and fine for many purposes
- Programmable pipeline offers maximum flexibility, state-of-the-art but it has significant start up cost.  

## Light

- Diffuse: pigment particles affect reflection
  - Lambert's law: $I_{\text{effective intensity}}=I_{\text{source intensity}}cos \theta$.
- Specular: pigment particles are not involved, no change of color
